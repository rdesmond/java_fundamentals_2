 * Data Types and Operators Exercise 3: Pig latin
 *
 *      Take in the user's name and print out their name translated to pig latin.
 *      For the purpose of this program, we will say that any word or name can be
 *      translated to pig latin by moving the first letter to the end, followed by "ay".
 *      For example: ryan -> yanray, caden -> adencay
 *
 *      HINT: We will make use of the substring() method.
